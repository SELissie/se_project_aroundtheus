#Around The U.S.

This is the third project of the Software Engineering Program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on a Figma design with no brief.

## Project Features

- A responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile views
- Flat BEM file structure
- Flexbox
- Grid

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma — we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
